## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

App: **Instagram**
- Constantly refreshing feed in realtime
- Sending text in vanishing mode

App: **Among Us**
- Realtime communication with other players on the internet.
- Moving icons in realtime.

App: **Netflix**
- The start-up screen
- The scrolling drop down menu that fades away as you scroll down

An application that I plan on developing in the nearest future is a business tracker for business owners. Essentially, this app helps business owners sort their businesses into the different industries as well as see different features like: revenue being created, money spent, budget allocation, market trends, update from other companies. This app would adapt new features like creating a visualization of a company as an icon. When you click on this icon, it shows you a bunch of other icons which represent the other features. For example, clicking on the budget allocation icon which could be a receipt emoji, would take me to a breakdown of how many is being spent in my business as well as the pay of each worker in the company. This app would also have certain features like changing the logo of the app to red if your company is not doing well or green if it is having an economic boom. Other features would include integrating AI to create potential strategies to giving your company an economic boost.

## Notes

This was a rather basic code so I did not come across much difficulties while doing this. The only problems will arise when you are not familiar with the IDE and while trying to integrate the button (object) into the code.
